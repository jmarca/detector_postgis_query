# Detector PostGIS Query

This module is a refactor of a program from geo_bbox.  I just want to
pull out the geographic query and make it all by itself, with tests.

# July 2016 updates

With the full-scale adoption of sqitch for the development and
processing of detector data vs OSM map data, the psql schemas and
tables need to be revised in the queries.
